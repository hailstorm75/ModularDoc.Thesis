\chapter{Plans for the future}

Completing the initial goal of this project was only the beginning. To gain user trust the project needs a suite of tests validating the behavior of the code, and to gain collaborator interest the project needs a well written wiki on how to extend the tool.

By themselves said tasks are no less complex as creating the tool itself, as great care and attention is required by both to guarantee positive results. Even if the project does not get the desired attention by the open source collaborator community, completing said tasks will only benefit me personally by providing a clear perspective on the state of the code, documentation to use when working on forgotten parts of the project, and, of course the valuable experience.
