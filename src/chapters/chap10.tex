\chapter{Tool usage and extension guides}

Consult this chapter to learn how to use and extend of ModularDoc.

In the context of this thesis ModularDoc was developed with only one plugin - \ref{gloss:markdown} for \ref{gloss:git}.
Thus, the user guide covers the tool with this plugin in mind.

The extension guide is designated for those, who wish to extend ModularDoc with new components, or plugin. ModularDoc also allows other areas of the application to be modified; however, due to the complexity and low necessity of these modifications, their description will be omitted from this guide.
