\chapter{Performance}

One of the goals of this thesis was to ensure that the resulting application performance is comparable, if not better, to existing tools. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate whether this requirement is satisfied.

The thesis project source code would be used for benchmarking performance.
The tests will run on a Windows Operating System, and shall compare performance of the project to DocFX, Doxygen, and SourceBrowser. Other solutions were excluded, as they do not produce proper documentation.

Testing will track human-percieved elapsed time, meaning that a user would run a given tool and manually track elapsed time. If the resulting tool is consistantly perceived to be considerably slower than existing tools, then the performance requirement can be deemed as unsatisfied.
