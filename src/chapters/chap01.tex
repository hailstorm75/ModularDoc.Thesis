\chapter{Short overview of .NET}
\ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} is a free developer platform for building various types of applications. With it, developers can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for the web, mobile, desktop, and more.
Officially supported languages include C\#, F\#, and Visual Basic, C\# being the most popular option. There are many other unofficial languages; however, most of them are no longer maintained.
