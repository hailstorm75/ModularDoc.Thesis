\chapter{Short overview of .NET} \label{chap:overviewNET}
\ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} is a free developer platform for building various types of applications. With it, developers can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for the web, mobile, desktop, and more.
Officially supported languages include C\#, F\#, and Visual Basic, C\# being the dominant option.

The developer platform has evolved over the years, split into different flavors, and renamed, inevitably confusing developers.
The following are the official .NET versions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item .NET Framework.
    \item .NET Standard.
    \item .NET Core.
    \item .NET.
\end{itemize}

\section{.NET Framework} \label{sec:netFramework}

The first platform was \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Framework. It is a proprietary, free-to-use developer platform, supporting the Windows \ref{itm:os} primarily. Microsoft no longer focuses on said platform and will only provide minor fixes if necessary. The last major version, 4.8, was released on the 18th of April 2019. The latest minor version, 4.8.1, was released on the 9th of August 2022.

\section{.NET Core and .NET} \label{sec:netCore}

\ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Core is the new open-source, cross-platform development framework from Microsoft. Its initial versions focused on web development with \ref{gloss:aspnetcore}. However, starting from version 3.0, Microsoft has ported to it their desktop-based \ref{itm:gui} frameworks (\ref{itm:wpf} and \ref{gloss:winforms}) from \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Framework.

Versions following \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Core 3.1 drop the \textit{Core} keyword and start the version number from 5.0. That is to indicate that \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} 5.0 and higher is the next iteration after \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Framework 4.8.

\section{.NET Standard} \label{sec:netStandard}
\ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Standard was used for sharing code between \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Core and \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Framework, as said frameworks are not cross-compatible. \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Standard had multiple releases, each exposing a more significant subset of shared \ref{itm:api}s between \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Core and \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Framework.

Microsoft has considered \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Standard obsolete since the release of \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} 5.0. Microsoft incentivizes developers to migrate all their projects to the new framework; thus, eliminating the need for \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} Standard.
