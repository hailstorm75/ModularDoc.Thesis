\chapter{Proof of concept}

Creation of a proof of concept application is the ideal first step when numerous unknowns are present. Thus, investing time into this stage should reveal the potential complexity of the full project, provide an opportunity for research, and present a big picture of the project, allowing further planning for the most efficient execution of development.

Development of the proof of concept took place in November, 2018. During said time, .NET Framework was still the dominant platform for desktop application development; thus, .NET Core, or .NET 5 and following version available today were not used in this stage. Specific differences between the .NET versions are out of the scope of this thesis. For more information see //TODO insert link.
