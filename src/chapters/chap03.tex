\chapter{Documentation tools}
\section{What is available?} \label{sec:whatisavailable}
The current documentation tool market provides the following solutions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item DocFX\footnote{\href{https://github.com/dotnet/docfx}{https://github.com/dotnet/docfx}}
    \item Doxygen\footnote{\href{https://www.doxygen.nl/}{https://www.doxygen.nl/}}
    \item Source Browser\footnote{\href{https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/SourceBrowser}{https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/SourceBrowser}}
    \item Vsxmd\footnote{\href{https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd}{https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd}}
    \item vsdoc-2-md\footnote{\href{https://github.com/discosultan/vsdoc-2-md}{https://github.com/discosultan/vsdoc-2-md}}
\end{enumerate}

What follows are evaluations of each tool which provides prospects on features and improvements that the custom tool can take advantage of.

\subsection{DocFX} \label{ssec:docfx}

\textit{DocFX} is an open-source documentation generation tool developed by Microsoft that not only supports \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} languages, but also Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and REST. Additionally, it can use raw \ref{gloss:markdown} files as input.

However, the \textit{DocFX} only outputs static \ref{itm:html} pages. The only available customizability is via templates for said static pages.

The tool is capable and is the go-to solution for \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} projects, but it doesn't solve the task of outputting \ref{gloss:markdown} files.

\subsection{Doxygen} \label{sec:doxygen}

\textit{Doxygen} is the industry-standard documentation generating tool originally made for C/C++ source code documentation. It has later added support for many popular programming languages such as C\#, Java, Python, and many more.

The tool provides an extensive set of supported output formats:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Static \ref{itm:html}
    \item \LaTeX\footnote{Document preparation system}
    \item Man pages\footnote{User manual type that is part of Unix operating systems \cite{credocs_limited_latex_2022}}
    \item \ref{itm:rtf}
    \item \ref{itm:xml}
\end{itemize}

It is possible to extend the tool, as it is open-source and available on GitHub. Unfortunately for \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel}, \textit{Doxygen} is written in C++ and its documentation does not provide any clear guidelines for extending its support for output formats. Naturally, a curious programmer can deduce how to do exactly that from the source code; however, other developers do not have capacity for such a feat.

\subsection{Source Browser}

\textit{Source Browser} is a tool that generates a website for browsing source code and its documentation. The tool is used by Microsoft, for example, to allow developers to browse the source code of \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel}.

The generated output is not fully static and has to be hosted on an \ref{gloss:aspnetcore} website to support searching.

\subsection{Vsxmd} \label{ssec:vsxmd}

\textit{Vsxmd} generates a single \ref{gloss:markdown} file for all types in a given assembly. Moreover, the tool has no \ref{itm:ui} and works as a \ref{gloss:nuget} package, that is added to the project designated for documentation generation. Thus, configuring this tool is done via \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} project settings.

It is not possible to navigate the documentation as no links are generated.

\subsection{Vsdoc-2-md}

\textit{Vsdoc-2-md} is an entirely unusable tool, as it is purely web-based and generates documentation from the provided \ref{itm:xml} documentation source file. The tool is limited to processing only one file at a time.

Just like \textit{\nameref{ssec:vsxmd}}, no links are generated; thus, it is not possible to navigate the documentation.

\section{What do users want?} \label{sec:whatdouserswant}
Surveying potential users of the tool is necessary to ensure that the developed product is utilized by more than its developer.
Thus, creating a questionnaire was the first step to success. Its purpose was to figure out the following key points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Whether users already use documentation generation tools, and if so, which ones
    \item What do users feel is missing from the tools they use
    \item What do users believe should be carried over to the new tool from the ones they use
    \item Whether users would integrate such tools into their \ref{itm:cicd} pipelines
    \item What output formats do users want
    \item What operating systems do users want the tool to work on
    \item Would users find a \ref{itm:gui} beneficial for such a tool
    \item Would users appreciate the tool being extensible via plugins
    \item Would users be interested in contributing to the project
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Questionnaire results}

What follows are the responses of the 22 participants of the questionnaire.

\subsection{Questionnaire evaluation} \label{ssec:questionnaireeval}

Those who find a use for such tools, want to export to static \ref{itm:html} and to have the ability to extend the functionality via plugins.
Other responses displayed a clear division of needs when it comes to \ref{itm:cicd} integration, the target \ref{itm:os}, and the need for a \ref{itm:gui}.
The dominant documentation generating tool for \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} is \nameref{ssec:docfx} (see \ref{ssec:docfx}).

Questionnaire takeaways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The majority neglects the importance of documenting code; thus, those who do and use documentation generating tools are part of a minute subset of all developers (see figure \ref{fig:qUsingToolsForDocGen})
    \item The tool should be cross-platform
    \item The tool must have good performance
    \item A console will be used by administrators of \ref{itm:cicd} pipelines and power users, while the \ref{itm:gui} will be useful for the rest
    \item Support for \ref{itm:cicd} is essential to fully automate documentation generation
    \item Even though the majority seeks to export to static \ref{itm:html} pages (see figure \ref{fig:qOutputFormats}), the project will focus on \ref{gloss:markdown} to fill in the market gap. The rest of the mentioned output formats will receive support later on (see below)
    \item \textbf{Extensibility via plugins will be the key selling point of the tool - it will enable anybody to modify the functionality to meet their specific needs}
    \item Future support for \nameref{ssec:docfx} (see \ref{ssec:docfx}) templates will help users migrate from said platform
\end{itemize}
