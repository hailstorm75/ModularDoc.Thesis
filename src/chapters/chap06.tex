\chapter{Basic structure}

The primary principle, Single-responsibility, separated operations within the application into the following key parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Member provider
    \item Documentation provider
    \item Composer
    \item Element provider
    \item Diagram generator
    \item Linker
    \item Printer
\end{itemize}

\section{Key parts} \label{sec:keyParts}

\subsection{Member provider}

The member provider will be responsible for loading type and member data from a given collection of sources into a collection of a defined data structure.
This collection will then be provided to the consumer of this key part via the relevant interface.
A concrete implementation of the interface would define the source type and the method for processing said source.

\subsection{Documentation provider}

The documentation provider will be responsible for loading documentation for specific types and members from a given collection of sources and mapping said documentation to the relevant types and members.
The map will then be available for querying to consumers of this key part via the relevant interface.
A concrete implementation of the interface would define the source type and the method for processing said source.

\subsection{Element provider}

The element provider will be responsible for providing structural elements for the visual representation of the generated documentation. Such elements would include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Text - regular text without any formatting
    \item Formatted text - text with formatting, e.g. bold, italic, code
    \item Lists - numbered, bullet, term lists
    \item Tables - headered tables
    \item Sections - content separators with headings containing all of the above
    \item Pages - content separators containing sections
\end{itemize}

Consumers of this provider would create required elements via the relevant interface.
A concrete implementation of the interface would define how said elements are to be represented, e.g. Markdown, \ref{itm:html}, \LaTeX.
