# ModularDoc Thesis

## Description

This repository contains the bachelor's thesis on the [ModularDoc](https://github.com/hailstorm75/ModularDoc) project.

## Abstract

This thesis aimed to research and develop a documentation-generating application for .NET libraries. The main objective was to create a tool for .NET developers that want to extract source code documentation and export it into their desired format while keeping the application extensible, cross-platform, and easy to use.

The theoretical part of the thesis covered the development planning and the expected result of the project.

The empirical part of the thesis describes the exact process of development. Designing a decoupled project structure had the most attention dedicated to it.

The result of this thesis project was a working cross-platform and open-source application, which can generate documentation from .NET libraries and is extensible via plugins.

The thesis concludes that there is a prospect to enhance the project with more plugins and features. Additionally, the introduction of sophisticated testing will ensure a high-quality codebase, attract contributors, and raise trust amongst users.
